In Finland we have all of the sudden these completely ridiculous alcohol laws. The latest incident was when a Beer & Whisky Expo in Helsinki had to remove the word Whisky from their name, and two private blogs were told to remove all mention of whisky when talking about said expo.

Seriously, what the actual fuck? The laws themselves prohibit alcohol advertising considerably (e.g. can't mention prices, no advertising of strong alcohol etc.) which is just fucking retarded. We had such laws and it's not like our reputation of a nation of heavy drinkers happened overnight. The laws are also based on a convenient truth - the lawmakers focused only on the very few studies that showed there to be any kind of correlation between alcohol advertising and alcohol usage.

Soooooooo anyway. That's fucking daft. I hate when government micromanages the everyday lives of its people. I hate it when absolute retards get to make up the rules.

So I made this extension that whiskyfies any webpage you visit.

## TODO

* Localization
* Change random images to whisky related content?
